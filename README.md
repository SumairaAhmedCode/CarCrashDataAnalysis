# Data Analysis Project: Road Crash Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on road crash analysis. The project utilizes a dataset with information about road crashes, including the date, time, location, borough, injuries, fatalities, contributing factors, vehicle types, and other relevant attributes.

The project aims to provide insights into the patterns, trends, and factors associated with road crashes. It utilizes various data visualization techniques to present the analysis in an accessible and informative manner.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from a reliable source or use your own road crash dataset. The dataset should contain the following columns:

- CRASH DATE
- CRASH TIME
- BOROUGH
- ZIP CODE
- LATITUDE
- LONGITUDE
- LOCATION
- ON STREET NAME
- CROSS STREET NAME
- OFF STREET NAME
- NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED
- NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED
- NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED
- NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED
- NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED
- NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED
- NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED
- NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED
- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1
- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2
- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3
- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4
- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5
- COLLISION_ID
- VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1
- VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2
- VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3
- VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4
- VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5

## Code

The analysis code is written in Python and utilizes popular data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code is organized into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis, such as data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and insights.

You can find the code for the analysis in the [CarCrashDataAnalysis.ipynb](CarCrashDataAnalysis.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook file in this repository. The notebook contains detailed comments explaining each step of the analysis and how the visualizations were created.

## Results

The data analysis project provides several insights into road crashes, including:

- Number of crashes over time
- Distribution of crashes by borough
- Total injuries and deaths in crashes
- Top contributing factors for crashes
- Geographic distribution of crashes
- Distribution of crashes by time of day
- Top vehicle types involved in crashes
- Correlation between numeric factors related to injuries and fatalities
- Number of crashes by ZIP code

These insights can guide decision-making processes, aid in the identification of areas for improvement in road safety measures, and support efforts to reduce the number of accidents and their associated impacts.
